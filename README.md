# 📚 BookStore Pro — Laravel Book Store Management System

Hello! I’m a student from LJ College (Ahmedabad), and I’ll be honest — it’s been a rough journey 😅  
My college experience wasn’t the best, but I never stopped learning.  
**Web Development is the only thing I’m good at**, and I put all my heart into this project.

This BookStore project is **70% of my hard work**, built alone — even though it was a group project for 3 people.  
I've also created other Laravel-based projects like:

-   💎 Jewelry Shop
-   🏋️ Gym Store
-   🍽️ Restaurant Ordering System  
    ...and more that I honestly don’t even remember!

But this one — **BookStore Pro** — is special. It’s my best work yet.
